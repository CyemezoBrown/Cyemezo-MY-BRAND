	<h1>Hello, Blogging is fun </h1>
	<p>This is my first blog to be presented to the world wide, hopelly you gone enjoy it.</p>

	<p >Blogging Goals</p>
	<h3>Contribute to the Web Dev Community</h3>
	<p>I'd like to be an active participant of the wide and wonderful world of web dev, not just a passive consumer. If it's possible for me to write some thing that one stranger on the internet finds useful, I'll have knocked this goal out of the park. I know I'm setting the bar pretty low, but hey, baby steps!

	If I had to venture a guess, I'd say that right now I'm most well known for having a neat portfolio website. Don't get me wrong, it's totally cool having any kind of recognition for your work. But I made this portfolio site over one weekend in 2015 while attending Startup Institute, and I totally cribbed the initial design inspiration from a website I found in the "Showcase" section of the MaterializeCSS docs . I never got to say thanks, Joel. So, thanks!
     
    So yeah I'd like to have a more interesting and meaningful impact, and that's a big part of why I want to start writing.</p>

    <h3>Communicate with Future Teammates or Employers</h3>
    <p>Crazy, right? Using this blog I can literally talk with people I don't know yet... from the future.</p>

    <p>In point #1 my audience is unknown, random folks hoping to solve a specific problem or learn something new. In #2 the audience is me. And in #3, my audience is people I may one day have the pleasure of working with. It's important to me (and hopefully to them, too) that we understand each other as well as possible, and I don't feel like the standard tech interview process always succeeds at accomplishing that. Sometimes stuff gets lost in translation or never gets translated at all.</p>

    <p>For example, one of the best parts of my job as a full stack developer at WeSpire is giving and receiving code review. It's an incredible opportunity to learn from others, to share best practices, to collaborate on different ideas and and approaches, to improve the product, and to champion the accomplishments and success of your coworkers. I can hear some of you at home (I've moved my audience goal post from one stranger to *gasp* multiple strangers, and the first blog post ink hasn't even dried yet! Ambitious.) are wondering if all that should really be within the purview of code review and, OK, that's fair. But the point is that communicating effectively is such a crucial part of being a good developer, and until now only a very small amount of people have gotten to see or hear me do that.</p>

    <p>If you, potential employer or coworker of the future, want to know how I think, how I express myself, or what I'm curious about, then I want this to be a good place to start. Hopefully you'll find my writing to be a more engaging and accurate representation of my work than the outcome of an arbitrary whiteboard algorithm session. I mean, those are totally fine for people that enjoy or excel at them but I'm not one of them.</p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting my blog just drop a comment.</p>
